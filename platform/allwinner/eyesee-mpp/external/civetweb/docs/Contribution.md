Contributing to CivetWeb
====

Contributions to CivetWeb are welcome, provided all contributions carry the MIT license.

- Please first create an issue on GitHub or create a thread on the CivetWeb discussion group. This is required, if the API ([civetweb.h](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/blob/master/include/civetweb.h)) is affected.
- If possible, create a pull request on GitHub. Please take care your modifications pass the continuous integration checks. These checks are performed automatically when you create a pull request, but it may take some hours until all tests are completed.
- Alternatively, you can post a patch. However, pull requests are preferred.
- Contributor names are listed in CREDITS.md, unless you explicitly state you don't want your name to be listed there.
